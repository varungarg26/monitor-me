# Sensu Go Ansible Collection

Sensu Go Ansible Collection is a bundle of Ansible content that we can use to
manage all aspects of Sensu Go. It contains Ansible roles for installing and
configuring backends and agents. Collection also contains a wide selection of
modules for runtime management of Sensu Go backend.

Collection is freely available on [Ansible Galaxy][galaxy]. For Red Hat
subscribers, this collection is also available on [Automation Hub][hub].
